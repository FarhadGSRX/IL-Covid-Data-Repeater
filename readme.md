# Illinois Covid-19 Data Repeater

Hello and welcome Illinois Covid-19 Researchers and Responders,

To facilitate your raw data needs, I am continually scraping and updating these google sheets with the numbers from the [IDPH Statistics front page](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics). 
The scraper automatically runs twice an hour at the 0015 and 0045 times. The sheets only update when there are new results from IDPH.
There are few hard data checks in place as the data is quite labile day to day, but size and shape of the data set are always ensured. 
(I am also manually checking everyday, at least through May.)

Please distribute freely.

Please, remember these are all _raw_ numbers from the IDPH Website.
I take no responsibility for their accuracy.

Cheers, Fg
