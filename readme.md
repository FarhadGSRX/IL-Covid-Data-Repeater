# Illinois Covid-19 Data Repeater

Hello Illinois Covid-19 Researchers and Responders,

To facilitate your raw data needs, I am continually scraping and updating these google sheets with the numbers from the IDPH Statistics front page.
The scraper runs automatically. The sheets (linked below) only update when there are new results from IDPH.
These are all _raw_ numbers from the IDPH Website. 

Please distribute freely.

### Notes:
On 4/18/2020, IDPH began to add a column for "Total Tested", the numbers for which on the first day are inconsistent with future uploads.
I have personally investigated my webscraper logs and have confirmed that this error was never corrected that day, but the numbers normalized the following day.

On 5/3/2020, I began scraping Google News to get a handle on the local news in our counties. That spreadsheet is also linked above.
